# Mini Project: Spam-or-Ham SMS

Classifying messages as Spam or Ham (non-spam) with Scikit-learn.

## Goal:

Using new data on spam emails, go through the entire data science lifecycle and develop a better model than the one developed in class while also evaluating the impacts and effects of imbalance data and different classification methods.

## Context

In UC Berkeley's Principles and Techniques of Data Science (Data 100) class, students were tasked to use what we have learned to distinguish spam or ham (aka non-spam) emails. This project is a continuation of that assignment as I wanted to see if I improve my model to obtain a higher accuracy. Furthermore, primarily I wanted use this project to gain more practice with the entire data science lifecycle and documenting my findings and approaches. In this project, I will be using a new dataset as specified below and then testing my old model to see how well it does with new data. Afterwards, I will be attempting to improve my previous model.


## Dataset:

The dataset used for this project is UCI SMS spam collection dataset. Link: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset/

Note: This dataset is not the same as the one used in the Data 100 class. Unfortunately, I don't have access to that dataset anymore and thus unable to provide it here.
